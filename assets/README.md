# Lab Documentation

This folder contains all supporting documentation and screenshots for the **Okta Offboarding Lab**.  

Each image illustrates a key step in the project, including:  
- Workflow creation in **Okta Workflows**  
- Variables and mappings used within the flow  
- Verification in Okta showing that the workflow executed successfully  
- Google Sheets entries confirming user details were logged automatically  
- Slack channel alerts confirming notifications were delivered  

Together, these screenshots provide a **complete visual record** of the workflow from trigger to output, demonstrating how offboarding actions are consistently documented across multiple platforms.
